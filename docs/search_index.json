Moreover, because all faces contain the same features (eyes, nose, mouth) in the same general configuration (eyes above nose, nose above mouth), distinguishing between individuals is a visually demanding task. Despite this, we are able to recognize individuals across a variety of superficial perceptual changes in lighting or viewpoint. Face recognition is critical to social interaction and it has received extensive attention from researchers using a range of methods. A human face reveals a great deal of information to a perceiver. It can tell about mood and intention and attentiveness, but it can also serve to identify a person. Of course, a person can be identified by other means than the face. Voice, body shape, gait or even clothing may all establish identity in circumstances where facial detail may not be available. Nevertheless, a face is the most distinctive and widely used key to a persons identity, and the loss of ability to recognize faces experienced by some neurological (prosopagnosic) patients has a profound effect on their lives. Here, we explore some of the psychological aspect of how faces are related by humans to beauty standards, commnication, familiarity and how human beings perceives faces and which facial or face related features are preferred by most of the students in the society. 3.1 Objective The motive of conducting this study is mentioned below- Finding out the overall face recognition ability among the college students of India and visualizing the results. Understanding the underlying correlation between the items(or questions asked) by different domains or aspects of face recognition(see next section). Understanding the underlying correlation between the different domains of face recognition. Finding out the domains and items connection with the way faces are percieved by the society. Observing the trend in the response like the composition of the overall face recognition score. 3.2 Importance Studies like this is very important in understanding the face recognition ability in psychology. Some reasons of why such studies are of great importance are as follows- Human faces are a very important mean to communicate and interact with others, understanding how human faces are percieved by society would help us know the importance of interacting face to face Understanding the the preferences of some facial features and overall looks over other, so as to erradiate any bias. Helps in understanding human-human interaction. Better understand the variables involved in study which can be as complex as social understanding, attention and perception, memory etc. "],["literature-review.html", "Chapter 4 Literature Review", " Chapter 4 Literature Review The human face is a very important visual stimulus in the human experiential world. It is a powerful social stimulus and is also responsible for drawing inferences about individuals we come across in our day to day lives. Information can be gained from both its static form and also its dynamic form the human face. Human faces are able to capture attention more easily than other objects (Ro, Russell &amp; Lavie, 2001). Additionally, it is believed that facial images also facilitate subsequent processing at the locations where they occur (Axelrod, Bar &amp; Rees, 2015). People also tend to make faster and greater accurate responses with regard to their own faces than in comparison to the faces of familiar others (Sui, Liu &amp; Hans, 2009; Tong &amp; Nakayama, 1999). Human beings tend to infer about individuals sex, race and age effortlessly and automatically from their faces ( Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000). These implications are based upon multiple features including hair, shape of face, the eyes and brows and even mouth (Brown &amp; Perrett, 1993; Roberts &amp; Bruce, 1988). Thus, facial features play a crucial role behind overall face perception. Another important aspect in this regard is related to memory. Memory works more in the domain of identification and recognition of human faces. Mostly all faces consist of similar features (eyes, nose and mouth) in the same configuration. Hence distinguishing among faces and recognizing them correctly becomes a very visually demanding task. Despite this we are able to identity /recognize individuals across a variety of environmental settings. Our faces also play a key role in mate selection and interpersonal relationships. Often biases exist in terms of which face we find attractive. Attractive people are also considered as more extroverted with higher level of self-esteem and enhanced social skills (Langlois et al.,2000). Based on the above evidences, the domains of memory, social understanding, attention, perception and facial features have been incorporated in the questionnaire for face recognition. "],["data-overview.html", "Chapter 5 Data Overview 5.1 Survey Form 5.2 Population 5.3 Collection 5.4 Data", " Chapter 5 Data Overview Here we shall explore the data we have collected from the 23 college students of India as a response to a survey form given to them. First we shall look at the survey form, then look at the actual data we have collected and as the last part of this section we shall see the different variables and domains involved in this study. 5.1 Survey Form To conduct the face recognition study, we circulated a survey form among college students of India through Google Forms. The Survey form comprised of 4 sections, each section pertaining to a particular domain of face recognition ability. Each section comprised of 5-7 questions framed to test the response towards that particular aspect of face recognition ability among students of India. Lets look at the sections and the questions asked in the form itself. 5.1.1 Domains These can also be referred to as the study variables and we have collected data on the following 4 domains of face recognition ability. These domains comprise of the overall face recognition ability of an individual. The domains are as follow: Memory(abbv. as MEM): It deals with the aspect of how humans remember familiar and unfamiliar faces. It also keeps a record of whether we can track the information about the identity of a person. We also see how well we remember our past friends and people we have met. Attention &amp; Perception(ATTNPER): It deals with how attentive we are to various parts of the face. How human faces are perceived by the society. It also deals with how human brain treat face as an important aspect of information processing. Social Understanding(SOC): It deals with how human face plays an important role in communication and interacting with the society. It also deals with how humans tend to prefer some pre-set standards of beauty in terms of facial look. Facial Features(FAC): It deals with what preferences in terms of external facial features prevails in the society. It also deals with the aspect of how a person looks at external beauty like shape, size, eyes, facial hair, smile, etc of a persons face. 5.1.2 Questions Here we will see the actual questions asked in the Survey Questionnaire Form. Each of these items club together to form the study variables, which further club together to form the overall pro-environmental attitude. MEM MEM1: I can easily remember unfamiliar faces. MEM2: I can easily recall familiar faces. MEM3: I find it easy to recognize my childhood friends. MEM4: I find it easy to identify people based on their facial features. MEM5: Overall I possess a good face-recognition ability. MEM6: I find it easier to recognize familiar faces but am often unable to trace their identity. ATTNPER ATTNPER1: I pay more attention to the human face as a whole in general. ATTNPER2: I tend to pay more attention to external features of the face. ATTNPER3: The face is a n important tool for information processing. ATTNPER4: I tend to focus more on the lower part of the face. ATTNPER5: I tend to attend faster to familiar faces than unfamiliar faces. SOC SOC1: I consider the human face as an important tool for daily communication. SOC2: I am easily attracted to beautiful and fair-skinned faces. SOC3: I am more keen to get involved with a person who is good-looking. SOC4: I feel that attractive people are able to get better opportunities. SOC5: I consider myself lucky that I have attractive facial features. SOC6: I get easily carried away by good-looks. FAC FAC1: I am more drawn towards the eyes of a person. FAC2: I dislike people with too much facial hair. FAC3: I like to keep my face clean and glowing. FAC4: I am easily attracted towards toned cheek-bones. FAC5: I prefer make up on my face/partners face. FAC6: I like people with sharp facial features, e.g.: sharp nose. FAC7: I like to mix with people who smile wholeheartedly.

We have students participating from various colleges and universities and various majors or areas of study fill this Survey Questionnaire Form. We are hence, targeting to study the face recognition ability of this population using our sample. 5.3 Collection The data was collected from the 23 college students of India via google forms. The sample is not a random sample and we used a method known as the snowball sampling to gather more students to fill the Survey form. The survey form had sections referring to each domain and data was stored in Google Sheets from where it was obtained as a CSV file to conduct our analysis. 5.4 Data Here we present the collected data from 23 college students.

The data collected for the study is available on the github repository for this project(here). "],["methods.html", "Chapter 6 Methods", " Chapter 6 Methods For analyzing the response data, drawing inferences about the underlying distribution and modeling the response to capture the trend or composition or hidden patterns between the study variables, I used several statistical tools as follows- Descriptive Statistics: It was used to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis. We saw the average scores, median, mode, etc. We did extensive data visualization and also started to understand the correlation between the items and domains involved in study variables. Inferential Statistics: It was used to find out Confidence Intervals, Test Hypothesis, Fit distributions to the data. Linear Regression: It was used to model the dependence of one variable on the other variables, understand and find the expected variable score. It captured the composition of the overall pro-environmental attitude. Clustering: Heirarchial Agglomerative Clustering was used to cluster the items, domains and respondents to understand the similarity and dissimilarity of study variables and low and high scorers. PCA: Principle Component Analysis was used to provide low dimensional summary of the data collected and understand the spread and inclination in the response data. Reliability Testing: It was used to find out the reliability of the response data we have collected. "],["results.html", "Chapter 7 Results 7.1 Visualization 7.2 Inference 7.3 Modeling 7.4 Clustering 7.5 Reliability", " Chapter 7 Results Here we will take a look at the structure of the data visually and through various tools available to us known as descriptive statistics and will also infer about these results. We will seek for hidden patterns, trends and dependence of variables in our data. We will examine the overall, item-wise per domain and domain-wise data and correlations. Our goal as before would be to extract as much information as possible, about facial recognition ability of college students of India from the response data. 7.1 Visualization I avoid presenting tables throughout the analysis as I believe the mere numbers presented as they are provide no information by just looking at them until and unless coupled with plots and necessary remarks and have kept them to be presented in the Appendix section, if needed. I tried presenting all the results of the data directly in the plots and have kept away from presenting too much cumbersome information. Every plot is coupled with necessary remarks and insight to be drawn. Lets look at the response proportion for each questions(we refer them as items). We see a there is almost a equal distribution of proportion of people on various items, we observe lesser disagree and strongly disagree compared to strongly agree and agree; neutral also seemed to be a highly chosen response , this hints us towards the fact that the students dont have a very high or very low facial memory, social understanding related to face recognition is not that prominent. They dont tend to pay more attention than needed to faces it seems. Facial features doesnt seem like very important. We will see more on this further in the study though several other plots and analysis. Before Looking into anything else, we see what the average facial recognition ability score of the students is and looking at the 95% confidence interval it seems the overall performance is slightly above 50%. We will now look at the correlation between several variables in our data i.e.Â the correlation between the items and the correlation between the domains and will draw necessary insight from them. After going through the questionnaire one can think that the questions all revolve around the same topic of face recognition so, we expect that the items and domains should be having strong correlation among themselves. We will see the validity of this in the analysis below. We take a look at the correlation between all the items response. We observe that there is a high positive correlation between all the items from all the domains. It means that people who Agree on one item are likely to Agree with most of the other items and vice-versa. The negatively correlated items(the darker cells) are very few in number and even if they are negatively correlated the strength is very low maxing out at -0.2(only one or two items) mostly between -0.1 and 0. We now look at the pairwise correlation between the domain scores of individuals. Since, all the domains are closely related to face recognition ability of an individual it is natural to expect that if a person scores high in any one domain he is likely to have higher face recognition ability overall (see this section called Modeling) and hence have high scores in the other domains too. The regression line fit also reveals positive slope, which means higher score in one domain is likely to imply higher score in other domains and hence overall higher face recognition ability(check further in the study to see this idea explored more). Now, after seeing the correlation between the net score of the domains. We take a closer look at each domains items and how they correlate among themselves. We got a rough idea of it from the first correlation plot of each item. This reveals that there is all the items in each domain are highly positively correlated with each other. There is no negative correlation observed between items of the same domain, which is consistent with what is expected. MEM6 and ATTNPER4 doesnt seem to correlate well with the other items. Students even though having high face recognition memory find it difficult to trace back identity and there doesnt seem to be any inclination towards lower part of the face. With this we have an overall idea of the correlation among items and domains as well as the proportion of subjects in the response data we collected. We will now move to the next section to infer something from the data. We will nonetheless carry on with visualizing the data wherever possible and necessary. 7.2 Inference Here in this section, we will conduct several hypothesis testings to find out statistically significant results i.e.Â if there is enough evidence to say that the population we are targeting posses high face recognition ability using the limited sample we have. We will also estimate several statistical measures like mean, give confidence intervals and fit probability density functions. In the following analysis, quite obviously higher score implies high Face Recognition Ability and lower score implies the opposite i.e.Â low Face Recognition Ability . We have already seen in the previous section how our sample shows vague(slightly high) face recognition ability i.e.Â the larger proportion of people stayed neutral or agreed to most face recognition items. Even though mean and median give good amount of information of the average behavior of the population using the sample, a good fit of probability density functions would reveal the behavior of the entire population and what overall shape of response histogram we can expect. We see that weibull, lognormal and gamma distribution fit all the scores the best out of our choice of probability density functions.(Best fit is decided by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit) Weibull distribution is similar to normal distribution but it accounts for the skewness or bias seen in the data whereas normal distribution is symmetric. The fact that these distribution fits better than normal is an evidence that the underlying distribution of the population is skewed towards higher score i.e.Â our population shows tendency towards slightly high face recognition ability. We will now look at the mean response score for each item in each domain and we have also mentioned the confidence interval for these scores. Most of the items have neutral responses. The mean score for each item is almost 3(sometimes lower, which is above 50% of the total score that can be obtained out of a total of 5). The standard error(which gives the confidence interval as the 95% confidence interval is nothing but the interval [mean-1.96*se, mean+1.96*se]) is low. So, looking at the 95% C.I. for the scores we can be sure that our sample definitely gives good estimate that the mean for each item is around 3 i.e.Â on an average the population does not posseses high or low face recognition ability. We see similar results as the above one from the net score in each domain. We see that that the average net score in each domain is 50% less than than the total score that can be obtained in that domain. The small 95% confidence interval makes us believe more that the sample average is indecisive standing at around 50% of the total score. Hence, in every domain we see only a slightly higher levels of face recognition ability. We will now see whether the males and females have different takes on face recognition ability. To do this analysis we frame our null hypothesis that males and females on an average dont differ in face recognition ability. We test this null against a two-sided alternative. We carried a two-sample t-test and found out that we are not able to reject the null hypothesis. Hence, we conclude that there is not enough statistical evidence that male and female differ on their take in face recognition ability. So, just as were doing from the start, we wont differentiate between male and female scores. We find that the average face recognition ability score of most of the domains are almost similar i.e.Â conducting the one-factor ANOVA test for equality of means we find that there is not enough statistical evidence to reject the fact that the means of all the domain scores are different. I strongly believe that these tests are limited by the sample size and if we had access to a bigger sample the means of all the domain scores in a single one-factor ANOVA test would come out to be same. With this we conclude the inference section of our study. We will use the insights gained from this section and the previous section to guide our data analysis further in the next sections. 7.3 Modeling In this section, we will see the dependence of one domain score on the other domain scores, the item scores on the domain scores and domain scores on the total scores. This will help us identify which domain score is the most differentiating so as to get higher face recognition scores. It is important because those are the domains we need to improve so as to achieve better total scores. We wont be fitting complicated black box models as our goal is not to predict the face recognition ability of a student rather we want to draw inferences from the models. Linear Models fit perfectly in that sense. First, we start by looking at the domain scores dependence on the other domain scores. This will help us get an idea of how knowing that one person scores in all the domains except one will perform in the left out domain. From the coefficient forest plot below we see that most of the coefficients in the significant linear model have high positive values. Thus, if a person has high scores in one of the domains, it is expected and observed that he will have high scores in the rest of the domain. We also observe all the other domain scores explains the variability of ATTNPR, SOC and FAC domain score(looking at the model R-squared values, these are above 60%) very well. MEM seems to be dependent on the FAC, SOC depends on ATTNPER and FAC, ATTNPR depends on SOC as well as FAC depends on SOC. Lets look at the dependence of the item scores on the domain score. We will look at it in two ways to better understand whats going on. We below fit a linear regression model of each item on the domain score, so as to understand given a particular total face recognition ability score in a particular domain, what is the expected scores in each of the items of that domain. We observe increase in any item score increases the overall score in that domain(from the correlation graphs among items we know one item score increases implies other scores are likely to be high too). We observe an issue with many items in all domains except SOC as even when the domain score is 100%(which means all item scores for that individual must be 5) our fitted regression line predicts that item score to be 4 or 3 and even 2 this means that the students even with high face recgonition ability find it difficult to agree with these items and on looking at these items we understand that students dont tend to remember identity and faces very well and they dont pay much attention to face, many students dont have strong preference for any facial features it seems. We also get an idea of which items are generally agreed by most of the people(even the ones with lower face recognition score) i.e.Â if we draw a vertical line in each of the plots we will get the score of each item predicted at that level of domain awareness. All the items in SOC has same predicted scores. Facial Memory tend to degrade over time. After we have seen the above insight, it is quite natural to ask how can we improve on the overall domain score by imparting education particular to each item. We will answer that now by looking at the dependence of Total Score in each domain on the item scores that compose it. Obviously, we see as expected that there is positive slope as increasing item score increases domain score trivially. One important thing to notice is that agreeing completely or scoring even full in one item doesnt imply that the overall domain score is near full, it maxes out at about 60% for almost all the domains, which reinforces the fact that students perform okayish in face recognition situations. We see that is the slope of MEM6 and ATTNPER4 are lower compared to rest of the items which implies as of now(from our samples level of face recognition ability) that students find it harder to remember faces and their identities and there is a no particular preference for the lower part of the face. Finally, we take a look on the same analysis we saw above for items conducted on domain level awareness and overall face recognition ability score. We breakdown the predicted composition of the total face recognition ability(overall score) in terms of the domain scores. We see that students have higher contribution in their overall face recognition score from the domain awareness of attention and perception. Apart from Attention and perception all the other domain scores maxes out at around 80% when the total score is 100%(i.e.Â all the domain scores should be nearer to 100%). So, as a result to see how the dependence of total scores are on the domain scores, mainly the slope will be important for us to analyse face recognition ability. It is again focused that the total score maxes out at about 90% even when all domain scores are 100%, which implies further students dont have a very clear or strong face recognition ability. This section provided lots of insight on the areas which comprises the face recognition ability of the students. Now, we move on to testing the reliability of the responses after a brief discussion on clustering 7.4 Clustering Face Recognition Ability Score consists of 4 domain scores as per our Questionnaire Survey. Since, our questionnaire captures the opinion or preference of the students, we might expect some students to have similar opinions on few items or domains and some have different opinions. Based on these opinions the items will also have different clusters capturing the similar trends in what the students believe. So, we are interested in taking a look at the clusters of similar items from all the domains as obtained from the observations and we are also interested in what composes the high-scorers(higher face recognition ability) overall face recognition ability. What are the domains students find it hard to see how important face is and remember them an idea about and how the items group together to convey similar ideas are some of the areas we will focus on in this section of the study. We will first take a look at correlation-distance based clustering of items. The way we interpret the dendrogram is the items that fuse further up in the dendrogram are more disimilar(based on correlation) to the items that fuse below. This reveals the underlying similarity of the items very well and also sheds light of the items that dont go very well with the rest of the items. Most items of MEM, FAC, SOC and ATTNPER cluster together in their own groups except for some questions which dont very well. Now, we will look at the clustering of items along with the clustering of students based on Maximum Distance(which best separated the classes of students based on their scores from low overall face recognition ability scorers to high overall face recognition ability scorers and also separated the items on which the students performed worst to best). Looking at the heatmap distribution, we see that most of the students stayed neutral or even disagreed and strongly disagreed to the items apart from ATTNPER and MEM2. Most student agreed with ATTNPER items like ATTNPER1, ATTNPER3, ATTNPER5, MEM2. Students have higher rate of response to known faces and they focus on face as an overall and not just a particular part. We now turn our attention to domain level analysis. Clustering based on correlation-distance as before revels which domain are similar to the other domains. If some domain is not similar to the other domain students lacks specially in this aspect of face recognition. We see students dont remember faces very well and have okayish kind of facial memory. We see reinforcement of the same fact as before i.e.Â students even though pay attention and have good perception of face find it hard to remember faces. They dont see faces to have a strong social impact and facial feature preference is mostly neutral. This section was very useful in understanding the underlying clustered behavior of the items and domains. It helped us further pin-point how the face recognition ability is distributed across various domains and people. 7.4.1 PCA With so many items of 5 scale rating, exploring the directions of the data that summarizes the overall response reasonably may give us an idea of which items and domain decides mainly the face recognition of the students. Firstly, we see on the Domain Level PCA. Seeing the overall spread of the data and the directions of strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree. We see students strongly agree on ATTNPER, agree on MEM and SOC, stay neutral, disagree and strongly disagree on FAC. The overall inclination strength in each of the domain can be understood from what is shown by the distribution of the data points below spanned by the two leading principal components. We will finish this PCA analysis with item level PCA. We get the directions of maximum variance of the responses. We see that the students strongly agree with items ATTNPER1, ATTNPER3, ATTNPER5, FAC7, SOC4, FAC1 and agree on MEM6, MEM4 i.e.Â students find face to be an overall entity without particular preferences for regions, they believe it to be important for information processing, familiar faces trigger response quicker. Whereas, we see that there is a strong disagreement on SOC items SOC2, SOC3, SOC5, ATTNPER2 with neutral and disagreement on rest of FAC and SOC items which reveals students either dont believe or are actually not attracted towards external features of the face and beauty. Though magnitude is less there is slight agreement on the fact that beautiful looks give better opportunity. 7.5 Reliability In this section, we will conduct reliability analysis of the survey response data.Reliability analysis allows you to study the properties of measurement scales and the items that compose the scales. The Reliability Analysis procedure calculates a number of commonly used measures of scale reliability and also provides information about the relationships between individual items in the scale. Hence, we will here get an overall index of the repeatability or internal consistency of the scale as a whole, and you can identify problem items that should be excluded from the scale We will start from Memory Domain and then will move on sequentially as the structure of Questionnaire and will obtain the reliability indices using the Cronbachs . We detect that there is a problem with the MEM6 item with the rest of the item in this domain. The r.drop value for MEM6 is very low which implies this item doesnt correlate well with the other items in this domain. Even the raw_alpha increases substantially if MEM6 is dropped. MEM6 doesnt fit reliably in the MEM domain and it might be a reason we saw it score low among the students in the previous section. Lets look at the Attention and Perception domain. The reliability score is very good(i.e.Â raw_alpha about 0.7). ATTNPER4 seems to be not correlating good with the other items in this domain. It might be because the question seems bit of a preference questions rather than a face recognition question. The reliability of SOC is very good. All the items fit good except SOC4 which is not that worse. Students tend to believe and at the same time unsure whether good looking persons get better opportunity. The reliability of the FAC Domains response is good. The FAC1, FAC6 and FAC7 seems to be little unrelated to the other questions. Now, if we look at the overall reliability of the entire questionnaire for finding the face recognition ability. It turns out that it has excellent reliability. Most the items fit in the scale very well given the goal is mainstream and we need to decide about the face recognition as a whole. But if each part of the survey on different domains are seen, then it turns out that few items for few domains dont fit in well in reliably finding the domain-level environmental attitude. We however see, as the domains item statistics shows, that some items doesnt fit well with the other items very well which are FAC1, FAC6, MEM6 and SOC4. This ends the reliability analysis of our response data and the reliability of all the domains are good. The overall survey for face recognition measure is excellent. Hence, we have covered almost all aspects of the response data and have explored the breadth and depth of the data. The summary of findings and suggestions drawn as a conclusion of the above analysis is presented in the Conclusion section of my study. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 8 Conclusion 8.1 Summary", " Chapter 8 Conclusion After an in-depth analysis of the response data on face recognition ability analysis among college students of India, this section will mark the end of this study. I will conclude the study by presenting a summary of findings and explanations. I would also provide necessary and important suggestions. One limitation that posed difficulty in analyzing the data was its small sample size. Further research and study on this face recognition ability analysis of students, in context of India is very important and is welcomed. 8.1 Summary We found several key fact and results from our analysis about the college students of India on constituting their face recognition ability. These findings are summarized as follows: Overall average face recognition score on our questionnaire is around around 60% with 95% confidence. The students shows only a slightly higher face recognition ability. Even the distribution of face recognition score is skewed not mch high peaking around average score. The facial memory, social understanding and importance of face, attention and perception to the face and facial features are highly inter related. Students dont pay much attention to the beautifying standards set by the society on good looks, fair skin, etc. Students agree slightly on the fact that good looking person get better opportunity. Students even though remember faces, find it difficult to remember the identity of the person. Students observe the face as an overall entity and doesnt focus on specific parts of a persons face. Students find face as an important mode of communication. Students tend to attend faster to known faces and familiarity with face plays an important role to students compared to unknown faces and unfamiliarity. This analysis sheds light on the several psychological aspects of human faces and how they are percieved, retained and understood by students.
